Chacma baboons are omnivorous feasting on many type of plants and animals. Their diet includes fruits such as figs and pinnata, eggs, Insects, small vertebraes and grass. Chacma baboons are quadrupedal and terrestrial primates. When they run, their style is similar to a horse’s gallop. They often spend their nights high up on tree's or rock formations to sleep and escape predators such as lion, cheetah and snakes. Chacma baboons have the largest home ranges and daily ranges of savanna baboon species. Home ranges have been reported to be between 3.5 and 13 miles (5.6-20.9 km). Their daily travels can be limited by availability of watering sites and sleeping locations. Males do not maintain lifelong ties with their kin. Female kinship forms the stability of chacma baboons society. Since females do not emigrate from their natal groups, female kin maintain lifelong associations. Within a group of chacma baboons, there is a dominance hierarchy of matrilines (a line of descent from a female), which means that a certain individual female is of high rank in the society. An individual female occupies a place in the dominance hierarchy under her mother and younger sisters. These dominance relationships develop from infancy. Interestingly within the matriline, the dominance relationships of sisters are inverse of birth order: the younger sisters are higher ranked than the older sister. These relationships sometimes cause differential treatment of offspring as well as others in the troop. The benefits of having this type of dominance society is that high ranked females have access to the best mates, have better access to food, receive more grooming, and get harassed less. Chacma baboons engage in a variety of visual, vocal, and tactile communication. They use facial expressions and body postures to communicate levels of excitement, arousal, or anger. Friendly and non-threatening behavior consists of soft grunts, avoiding eye contact, and retracting lips to display their clenched teeth. Presentation of the rump is used as an invitation by sexually receptive females, but it can be used as a signal by both sexes. The reproductive behavior in chacma baboons is closely tied to social organization. In multi-male, multi-female troops, it is likely that any male can mate with any female. Thus, males compete for mates. There is also a link between a male’s rank within the troop and mating success. Most of the time, males with a higher rank have a better ability to compete for mates. Larger, stronger, and sometimes even younger males have the best success. Females exhibit a preference for mating with their male friends, since they prefer their friends as mates. When a female is ready to mate, she presents her rump to those males. Sometimes females develop an alliance with new males that immigrate into the troop to help their chances of success. There is a significant amount of female mate choice in chacma baboons.

The Guinea baboon (Papio papio), also known as the red baboon, is widespread across West Africa and the southwestern Arabian Peninsula. Populations are found in Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, southern Mauritania, western Mali, Gambia, Senegal, and northwestern parts of Sierra Leone. Guinea baboons are opportunistic and adaptable omnivores. Like humans, they have great diversity in their diet. Unique ecological ranges and seasonality greatly influence their food selection. A wide assortment of woody plants (trees, shrubs, and lianas), fleshy and dry fruits, seeds, young leaves, flowers, buds, insects, invertebrates, eggs, and birds make up their diet. A key food source is the Borassus akeassii fruit, which grows abundantly in forests along rivers and wetlands. Guinea baboons are diurnal, meaning they are awake during the day and sleep at night. They are primarily terrestrial (ground-dwelling) and travel quadrupedally as they forage in small groups, scaling various landscapes for food. Male-led groups fuse and drift apart depending on daily activities and safety. Groups are always situated near a permanent body of water. The sleep site selection patterns of Guinea baboons are quite exceptional. To avoid predation, anywhere from 40 to 100 individuals band together before retiring for the night (there’s always strength in numbers). Groups seek trees (preferably palms) with wide trunks that are difficult to climb. To reach a branch, they leap from a taller access point—a nearby tree, rocky ledges, and even cliffs. Guinea baboon’s social dynamics are somewhat unique compared to other Papio species. They live in intricate, male-dominated, multi-faceted social groups. Their relationships are complex, but also very accepting and often promote positive social engagement. Their multi-level, fission-fusion social structure—in which groups join together or break apart based on the groups’ needs and activities—includes stable bonds between males and females as well as a high degree of male‐male cooperation and tolerance. Within this social structure, male Guinea baboons showed far less rivalry between and among other males, regardless of relatedness, as well as less aggression towards females than some other baboon species.The first level of organization begins with a social group called a one-male unit (OMU). It consists of one male, a small band of females (usually one to four, known as a harem), and their young. Males do not aggressively herd their units but instead motivate and persuade movements by corralling, shaking, and jumping. If a traveling group needs to change direction, a male will speed up and begin to prance about to encourage a turn.The next level of organization occurs when multiple OMUs band together to form what is known as a party or clan. Several parties come together and become a gang. Some gangs can have 300 to 500 individuals. This is an expression of fusion, which comes in handy when sleeping, traveling, defending against predators, or participating in productive social activities. Clans often break apart (fission) when they awaken and begin foraging for the day. It is important to note that, unlike other species, female Guinea baboons have a high degree of freedom. Males do not restrict their movements and consent to an open choice of social partners. Females are free to visit with relatives who have left for different OMUs. They’re even allowed to be shared with males from other groups—a practice that would typically trigger competition and conflict in other baboon species. Guinea baboons are highly social monkeys that use physical and vocal communication methods.Physical communication varies and depends on context, social setting, and individuals’ moods. Touching, posture, and facial expressions—such as certain blinking patterns or staring, the twitch of the ear or lip, and even a yawn—may not seem like much to us, but to them, present colorful language. In affiliative or social situations, males are known to fondle another when greeting a bonded member or friend. Grunts are the most common and are exchanged during greetings, affiliation, copulation, and infant care. Guinea baboons may scream during agnostic interactions. During foraging, if males cannot see more than 5–10 members of their subgroup, they will use a “wahoo” call for intergroup spacing. This is also used when they spot a predator or a different gang. A series of roar grunts is often exchanged during travel, or if females are acting aggressively. In these cases, they are known to flee up trees, yawn, and shake branches in protest.
